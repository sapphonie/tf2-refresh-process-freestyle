[b]INTRODUCTION[/b]

"Refresh:" is a series aimed at making maps more suitable for 6v6 and other gamemodes. We took the opportunity to use our experience to fix the issues with map geometry as well as minor aesthetic and performance improvements. We humbly invite you to try out these changes and offer your feedback, so that together we are able to increase the quality of the competitive map pool.

[b]SUMMARY[/b]

Warmtic has been around a while in Highlander but we noticed it was getting quite low reviews from players in ETF2L's last poll. Most changes you'll see here aim to only improve gameplay, not change. Most hiding/perch spots have been left in.

[b]CHANGES[/b]
F1:
[spoiler]Lighting: 
 • [url=https://i.imgur.com/8fuDCBm.jpg]HDR has been lowered slightly.[/url]
 • Removed unnessarcy lighting left over from koth_arctic.

Optimization:  
 • Slightly better FPS (maybe lighting entities left over from koth_arctic have been removed, 
 these are necessary anymore because the map isn't at night)

Detailing :

 • Improved when props fade out.

Clipping:
